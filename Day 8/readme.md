# DAY8
Hey, #connections I'm thrilled to share that I've completed my DAY 8 of the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Today I solved two leetcode problems:- Problem 1: "1480 Running Sum of 1d Array" and Problem 2: "2114 Maximum Number of Words Found in Sentences"

I'm so glad to participate in this challenge and push myself to become a better coder. It's amazing what a little bit of focus and determination can do. I can't wait to see what the next 92 days bring.
