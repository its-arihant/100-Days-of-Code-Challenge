# DAY35
Hey, #connections I'm thrilled to share that I've completed my DAY 35 of the #100DaysOfCode challenge. After solving some basic leetcode problems from today I started learning DSA in Python language. Today I learned about the analysis of algorithms and solved basic math problems and tried to find their time complexity

I'm so glad to participate in this challenge and push myself to become a better coder. It's amazing what a little bit of focus and determination can do. I can't wait to see what the next 65 days bring.
