Hey, #connections I'm thrilled to share that I've completed my DAY 36 of the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Today I learned about the analysis of recursive algorithms and solved basic math problems that require recursive approach and tried to find their time complexity. A function that calls itself is said to be a recursive function. To find the time complexity in recursion we follow three methods: Recursive tree method, substitution method, and master method.

I'm so glad to participate in this challenge and push myself to become a better coder. It's amazing what a little bit of focus and determination can do. I can't wait to see what the next 64 days bring.
