# DAY1
Hey, #connections I'm thrilled to share that I've completed my DAY 1 of the #100DaysOfCode challenge, and I'm already making progress.I am revising my python basics and learning OOPS with python. With this today I solved one leetcode problem - "1929 Concatenation of Array" 

I'm so glad to be taking part in this challenge and pushing myself to become a better coder. It's amazing what a little bit of focus and determination can do. I can't wait to see what the next 99 days bring
