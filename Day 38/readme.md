# DAY38
Hey, #connections I'm thrilled to share that I've completed my DAY 38 of the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Today I solved 1 basic math problem that return true if the given number is a prime number else return false. So I solved it using 3 approaches to get the efficient code.

I'm so glad to participate in this challenge and push myself to become a better coder. It's amazing what a little bit of focus and determination can do. I can't wait to see what the next 62 days bring.
