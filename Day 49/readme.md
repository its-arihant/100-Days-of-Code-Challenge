# DAY49
Hey, #connections I'm thrilled to share that I've completed my DAY 49 of the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Today I solved one leetcode problem:- "1281 Subtract the Product and Sum of Digits of an Integer"

I'm so glad to participate in this challenge and push myself to become a better coder. It's amazing what a little bit of focus and determination can do. I can't wait to see what the next 51 days bring.
