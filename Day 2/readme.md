# DAY2

Hey, #connections I'm thrilled to share that I've completed my DAY 2 of the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Today I solved two leetcode problems:- Problem 1 - "1920 Build Array from Permutation" and Problem 2 - "1470 Shuffle the Array".

I'm so glad to be taking part in this challenge and pushing myself to become a better coder. It's amazing what a little bit of focus and determination can do. I can't wait to see what the next 98 days bring.
