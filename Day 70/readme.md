# DAY70
Hey, #connections I'm thrilled to share that I've completed my DAY 70 of the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Today I solved one problem: "Finding The leader in an Array". An element is said to be the leader if the element is greater than all the elements on its right hand side.

I'm so glad to participate in this challenge and push myself to become a better coder. It's amazing what a little bit of focus and determination can do. I can't wait to see what the next 30 days bring.
