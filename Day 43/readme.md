# DAY43
Hey, #connections I'm thrilled to share that I've completed my DAY 43 of the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Today I learned about an efficient algorithm: Sieve of Eratosthenes for printing the prime numbers till the number entered by the user.

I'm so glad to participate in this challenge and push myself to become a better coder. It's amazing what a little bit of focus and determination can do. I can't wait to see what the next 57 days bring.
