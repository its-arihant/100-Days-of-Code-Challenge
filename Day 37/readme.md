# DAY37
Hey, #connections I'm thrilled to share that I've completed my DAY 37 of the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Today I solved more basic math problems that require recursive approach and tried to find their time complexity. 

I'm so glad to participate in this challenge and push myself to become a better coder. It's amazing what a little bit of focus and determination can do. I can't wait to see what the next 63 days bring.
