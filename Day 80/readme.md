# DAY80
Hey, #connections I'm thrilled to share that I've completed my DAY 80 of the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Today I solved one leetcode problem:- "1464 Maximum Product of Two Elements in an Array"

I'm so glad to participate in this challenge and push myself to become a better coder. It's amazing what a little bit of focus and determination can do. I can't wait to see what the next 20 days bring.
